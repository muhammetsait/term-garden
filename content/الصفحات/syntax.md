Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing, or transforming the symbols and words of a language, as contrasted with the [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_(logic) "Formal semantics (logic)") of a language which is concerned with its meaning.

[syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages) "Syntax (programming languages)") refers to the rules governing the composition of well-formed [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)") in a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"). As in mathematical logic, it is independent of semantics and interpretation.

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), the **syntax** of a [computer language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language "Computer language") is the rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured [statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science) "Statement (computer science)") or [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science) "Expression (computer science)") in that language. This applies both to [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"), where the document represents [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code"), and to [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language"), where the document represents data.
