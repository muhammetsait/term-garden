In [programming language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory "Programming language theory"), **semantics** is the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)#cite_note-1) Semantics assigns [computational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation") meaning to valid [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)") in a [programming language syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_syntax "Programming language syntax"). It is closely related to, and often crosses over with, the [semantics of mathematical proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_of_logic "Semantics of logic").

**Semantics** describes the processes a computer follows when [executing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing) "Execution (computing)") a program in that specific language. This can be done by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or giving an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain [platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_platform "Computer platform"); hence creating a [model of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation "Model of computation").
