# Best Programming Language

Learn something, anything, stop looking for the best thing to learn

Best language, best framework, best etc. Instead of spending time finding a thing to learn, and end up learning nothing, just sit and learn something.

Don't try to have the most optimized life. What's best than the most optimal workout? the one that you follow and do. The thing that you do again and again, is better than what you do only once.

And then maybe you'll be excited to improve.
